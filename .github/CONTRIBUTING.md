Pull requests are happily accepted here, but please note the following:

If you're planning to submit a non-trivial change, please discuss this in an
issue first, to get an idea if it might be accepted.

Any changes to [the Imposm config](../imposm/) require a complete rebuild of the
OpenInfraMap database - a fairly manual process which takes about a week.
Please submit these in a separate pull request from any other changes and note
that these may have to wait several months until I have a window of time to
rebuild.

Please don't combine changes which depend on a new Imposm config with ones which
don't, or you risk having your changes left for months.
